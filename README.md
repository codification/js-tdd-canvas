js-tdd-canvas
=============

A canvas using a canvas. Yet another experiment in making things hard for myself.

I am trying to learn:
* HTML5 Canvas, preferably for simple 2D game programming
* AMD modules, how to test and compose them
* Functional programming in JavaScript, prefer namespaces, functions and structs to objects and classes

All the while I stick to:
* TDD

I am hoping to show:
* That anything can be tested
* That functional programming rocks
* TDD and functional programming lead to modular, composable code

What I am _not_ trying to do:
* Implement a really good game really fast
* ...
